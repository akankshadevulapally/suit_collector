# Trained an AI agent for the game "Suit Collector", using Anaconda, Gymnasium. Employed Reinforcement Learning methods,
including Deep Learning, Temporal Difference Q-learning algorithm, Double Q-Networks (DQN), Experience Replay, and Epsilon-
Greedy strategy to train the agent.
â€¢ Enhanced agent performance by implementing a reward system across various modules, resulting in significant performance
improvements.
